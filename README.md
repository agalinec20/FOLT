The FOLT project was developed as part of the Advanced Web Technologies and Services course. It represents a multi-server application that simulates
a complete food and beverage delivery system. The system is built using Java and Jakarta EE technologies, combining socket-based communication between
servers with RESTful web services for data exchange and management. The architecture includes several interconnected components: the company server, 
which manages partners, menus, drinks and billing; the partner servers, which handle customer orders; and the client application that interacts with 
the system. Each module communicates through network sockets while the REST API provides centralized access to system data and operations. The project 
also integrates a web interface built with JSP and Jakarta Faces, allowing users to monitor system status, manage partners, and perform 
administrative actions based on assigned roles. Through this implementation, the project demonstrates the practical application of distributed systems, 
concurrent programming and service-oriented architecture within a realistic food delivery scenario.
